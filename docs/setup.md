# Interactive sandbox setup

The durable contract is [container-setup](../openspec/specs/container-setup/spec.md).
The [archived change](../openspec/changes/archive/2026-11-07-add-interactive-container-setup/)
retains the design, completed tasks and delta specifications.

Setup is the mandatory first step for new users. Run
`bash ./claude-container.sh --container-setup` from a reviewed checkout,
as the non-root Linux/WSL user who will use the sandbox. Podman and its rootless
dependencies must already be installed. Host Python 3, Bash and GNU coreutils
are also required. Setup needs terminal stdin/stdout; redirected answers and
combinations with launch flags or Claude arguments are rejected. Help is always
available through `--container-help` without loading preferences or using Podman.

## Choices and preparation

The prompts cover network access, account/API authentication for online use,
shared/fresh isolated state, delegation, permission bypass, worktree scope, host
CA trust, installation/command paths and the Podman endpoint. Provider choices
select `anthropic-account` or `anthropic-api` from the protected packaged policy.
No API key is needed for account use. First-run setup defaults to provider mode
with account authentication, shared state,
ordinary Claude approvals, current workspace only, delegation off and CA trust off.
Accept defaults with Enter; invalid choices are requested again. Existing saved
choices are offered for review on rerun, including a previously selected offline
mode. The managed launcher applies the saved network choice. Ordinary direct
invocation with `CLAUDE_CONTAINER_NETWORK` unset or empty stops with setup
guidance before runtime prerequisite checks, engine queries or state creation.
Setup is never started automatically. An explicit empty network override on a
managed invocation also receives this refusal; remove the override to use the
saved choice. Offline mode cannot reach the Claude API.

After the worktree question, setup asks for the agent budgets and lifetime:
`Agent memory limit` (default `4g`), `Agent CPU limit` (default `2`),
`Agent process limit` (default `512`) and `Session lifetime in seconds, 0
disables` (default `0`). Invalid answers are explained and asked again; `0`,
`-1`, `max` and unitless memory are rejected, so a budget cannot be disabled.
The setup plan lists the values. They are saved in schema 2 preferences and
supplied by the managed launcher as `CLAUDE_CONTAINER_MEMORY_LIMIT`,
`CLAUDE_CONTAINER_CPU_LIMIT`, `CLAUDE_CONTAINER_PIDS_LIMIT` and
`CLAUDE_CONTAINER_RUN_TIMEOUT` unless those are exported. Smoke and
qualification use the saved values. To change a budget, rerun setup; an
exported different value makes restricted launches stop until
`--container-qualify` is run with the same environment. Preferences saved by an
earlier release (schema 1) are read with the default budgets proposed.

Setup smoke, qualification and optional login run in a private temporary
workspace, never in the directory from which setup was started. Ordinary
launches refuse sensitive workspace roots such as `/`, your home, system
directories and WSL drive roots unless exact
`CLAUDE_CONTAINER_ALLOW_UNSAFE_WORKSPACE=1` is set.

Operators can still invoke a manually prepared wrapper with explicit `offline`,
`provider` or `unrestricted` mode. All existing prerequisites, protected paths,
qualification and authority checks apply. Image maintenance additionally
requires exact `CLAUDE_CONTAINER_MAINTENANCE=1`; that consent alone does not select
a mode. Help and standalone setup/qualification retain their own dispatch checks.
Standalone `--container-qualify` keeps its offline default when no mode is set
and can run only fixed controls, never a supplied application command.

Before `c777b73`, ordinary networking needed no runtime-mode selection. The
enforced-network change introduced an unset/empty offline default; ordinary
missing-mode launches now stop with setup guidance instead. Existing managed
launchers supply a saved mode. Install the updated protected wrapper through
setup, or update and requalify a manual restricted installation: changing the
wrapper invalidates its old qualification identity. Existing activation and
last-working-release rollback remain unchanged.

The N23 transport update also requires matching protected code, runtime image
and immutable proxy image: both images embed the multiplex implementation.
Prepare them under explicit maintenance consent and rerun setup or manual
qualification; old code/image fingerprints cannot authorize the candidate.
Existing running sessions keep their original transport and need a restart to
gain stream-failure isolation. Failed qualification keeps the previous activation.
Rollback uses the previous protected release with its matching images and a
currently valid report, requalifying when required. No fallback network mode is
selected during update or rollback.

Provider mode authorizes CONNECT hostname/address and requires matching SNI in
the initial TLS ClientHello, and in the retried ClientHello after a TLS 1.3
HelloRetryRequest, before forwarding client bytes. TLS 1.2 renegotiation is
encrypted and not inspected. It preserves
end-to-end certificate verification. ECH (including GREASE), missing/malformed or
different names and inspection timeout/overflow fail closed. Encrypted HTTP
Host/authority, shared-service routing and provider forwarding remain opaque;
this does not guarantee exclusive access to Anthropic applications. Allowed
services can still receive session data.

Selecting provider mode prints a residual-exfiltration notice listing the hosts
of each profile (`account: api.anthropic.com, platform.claude.com`;
`api: api.anthropic.com`) and asks `Acknowledge that allowed provider hosts can
receive data sent with foreign credentials? (yes/no)`. Destination binding cannot
tell your credentials from attacker-supplied ones, so a prompt-injected agent can
send workspace data to an allowed host with a foreign API key or account. Answering
`no` returns to the network-mode question; no other mode is chosen for you. The
acknowledgement is required on every setup run that selects provider mode,
including the delegation-conflict network change, and is not saved. Only offline
mode removes this channel; see
[Residual exfiltration](network-contract.md#residual-exfiltration-to-allowed-services).

The candidate image and protected release must both implement
`tls-clienthello-sni-v2`; missing/old enforcement identity fails readiness before
agent startup and candidate activation. Deploy matching code and image together.
Unsupported clients require a supported non-ECH configuration; failures never
trigger unchecked tunneling. A rollback to a historical release also removes
this guarantee; use offline mode if the stronger boundary is required until a
compatible candidate passes. Existing maintenance consent and rollback remain
in force.

Restricted modes admit native Linux and WSL2 x86_64 with usable Landlock ABI >= 3,
rootless same-host Unix Netavark/Podman >= 4.9 and standard OCI seccomp, followed
by mandatory local qualification. There are no exact kernel pins or server upper
bounds. Enabled SELinux/AppArmor is permitted without guaranteeing compatibility;
denials stop preparation while policies stay active. Setup diagnoses missing
Podman, UID/GID mappings/helpers, runtime directories and unsupported engines.
Fix those host prerequisites separately. Setup never installs host packages,
uses sudo, edits subordinate-ID mappings, enables lingering, changes WSL init,
disables security policy or silently selects unrestricted networking.

Every agent container, in every mode, and every provider proxy drops all
capabilities and enables no-new-privileges. Setup smoke verifies zero capability
sets, no-new-privileges and the effective agent `memory.max`, `pids.max` and
`cpu.max` in every mode, so rootless cgroup v2 `cpu`, `memory` and `pids`
controllers must be delegated. Provider proxies additionally receive 256 MiB and
128 processes.
The installed wrapper verifies the effective limits and proxy hardening before
its smoke agent starts. An unavailable controller, ignored limit or incompatible
image makes setup incomplete and preserves the previous working release.
Inspect controller delegation and image compatibility separately; setup never
adds privileges, changes host security policy or removes limits to proceed.

Before activation, setup runs `--container-qualify` against its protected
candidate using fixed disposable IP/IPC/TLS controls and no real credentials.
Only a complete passing result is published atomically under the release's
private `qualification/` directory. A failed or interrupted candidate keeps the
previous release selected. Authentication remains a separate status.

Existing managed installations must rerun setup. Manually prepared installations
can invoke `--container-qualify` alone with their existing explicit environment
configuration; this command never starts an ordinary Claude session or grants
maintenance. Help and unrestricted launches do not require a report.

For the provider idle-channel fix, rerun setup from the updated reviewed checkout
and explicitly approve maintenance and image refresh so both the runtime and
proxy images contain the same updated multiplex receiver. Install the matching
protected release and let normal qualification regenerate reports for its changed
code and immutable image identities; an old report must not be copied or reused.
The guard ABI and mux wire version remain unchanged. Relaunch existing sessions:
their preconnected channel cannot be repaired after closure. The optional
`bash tests/run-runtime.sh --guard-idle` check documented in `network/README.md`
verifies reuse after a real 305-second pause without authentication. Rollback
uses the retained last-working release and its normal qualification checks;
the previous receiver still has the five-minute inactivity defect.

Reports bind kernel/boot, ABI, engine/backend/security artifacts, protected code,
immutable images, selected policy/profile, CA trust and hardening. Relevant changes
require requalification. Unobservable active LSM policy state forces a new gate
each ordinary launch rather than unsafe reuse. Missing/stale/unsafe reports and
unavailable required controls block launch; permissions are not repaired.
Setup distinguishes `locally-qualified` from an exact `release-measured` record.
Local success is not a claim about every native distribution, LSM or auth flow.

For restricted launch or optional delegation, setup verifies the selected
same-host rootless Unix service. `default` derives the socket from the current
`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (or `/run/user/<uid>`) on every invocation; an explicit
`unix:///absolute/socket` is retained literally. `local` is available for
unrestricted launch without delegation. TCP/SSH, named contexts and implicitly
remote engines remain unsupported. Bind/build paths must exist at their real
absolute paths on that same Linux host, including when running from a container.

When available, setup can run `systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket`
after separate confirmation. This persistent user-service change does not
delegate the socket to the application. Without a working user manager, setup
prints foreground `podman system service --time=0` instructions and stays
incomplete until an endpoint is verified. It does not leave a background daemon
or repair an administrator-owned `/run` directory. A service enabled before
later cancellation is reported and retained, since other clients may use it.

Review the settings and image plan before approving preparation. A separate
refresh question allows rebuilding prepared images/guard. Builds and pulls are
host maintenance: their network traffic, including build-time package downloads,
is outside runtime egress filtering even when the chosen session mode is offline.
Consent grants exact maintenance authorization only to these preparation
commands. It is not saved or enabled for subsequent ordinary launches.

Every mode needs a runtime image; restricted modes also need the static guard
and its digest manifest. Provider additionally needs the immutable proxy image,
selected policy and private egress runtime directory. Setup reuses inspected
artifacts when suitable and prepares missing ones from the existing recipes.
Compiler tools are installed only in the pinned toolchain image. Compilation
uses that immutable image without networking. Failed recipe/package acquisition
does not change pins automatically; resolve the reported maintenance stage and
rerun. Unrestricted mode skips the guard/toolchain/proxy, and offline skips the
provider proxy/authentication.

## Managed installation and launch

Default paths:

- Installation: `$HOME/.local/lib/claude-container` on native Linux storage.
- Command: `$HOME/.local/bin/claude-container`.
- Egress state: `$HOME/.local/state/claude-egress`.
- Optional fresh isolated home: `$HOME/.local/share/claude-container/home`.

Source may be on a Windows mount; installation, private state and executable
guard output need permission-enforcing native storage with protected ancestors.
Setup copies an explicit input manifest, never a whole checkout or credentials.
Group/other-writable ancestors, unsafe existing modes and paths overlapping the
writable workspace/worktree/state are rejected without recursive repairs.
An existing safe flat manual installation can coexist with managed releases.
An absent installation directory is created with mode `0700`. An existing
caller-owned `0755` installation root is accepted without changing its mode:
installation code requires write protection, while credential/state directories
and managed releases retain their private permission checks. Invalid ownership
or inaccessible existing roots are diagnosed before maintenance confirmation.

The configuration directory, or the isolated state directory, must belong to
the caller, permit read/write/traverse access and deny all group/other
permissions. Whether shared directories (the profile's `native.shared_dirs`;
for Claude `~/.config/openspec`) must also be private depends on the optional
profile field `native.private_shared_dirs`:

- `false`, the default and Claude's value: shared directories are created
  privately when missing and must be accessible. Existing modes are kept.
- `true`: the wrapper refuses non-private shared directories. Setup then checks
  them the same way as the configuration directory, before any image work.

A refusal names the path and the reason: not a directory, another owner,
missing access, or group/other permissions with the observed mode. Setup never
changes permissions itself; for example, a host tool that created a directory
with mode `755` is reported with the fix `chmod 700 <path>`, or with native
Linux storage when the filesystem does not enforce Unix modes. The setup
summary calls a state directory `private` only when it passed this check;
other directories are listed as `shared`.

Each `releases/<id>/` contains its runtime/setup/build inputs and private
versioned `setup.json`. `current` selects the active release. Setup holds
`.setup.lock` during preparation/activation and publishes the pointer only after
the candidate smoke check passes. A failed candidate is removed; the last
working release and credential state are preserved. Concurrent setup fails with
a busy message. Remove a stale empty `.setup.lock` only after confirming that
no setup process is active. An unrelated command file or reserved-path symlink
is never overwritten.

Use the absolute completion command, or add its directory to PATH yourself:

```bash
cd /path/to/my-project
"$HOME/.local/bin/claude-container"
"$HOME/.local/bin/claude-container" --container-shell
"$HOME/.local/bin/claude-container" --container-setup
```

Setup does not edit shell startup files. If the command directory is absent from
PATH, the plan and completion output
show a shell-quoted `export PATH=/absolute/command/directory:"$PATH"` command and
suggest adding that line to the appropriate shell startup file for persistence.
The managed command loads validated
non-secret JSON and execs the installed wrapper; preferences are never sourced
as shell code. It preserves current directory, stdin, arguments, terminal and
exit/signal handling. Settings provide defaults only for variables absent from
the environment. Explicit values, including empty values, take precedence and
must pass normal validation. A nonempty `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` conflicts with an
isolated home; unset it deliberately rather than expecting setup to discard it.

The installation and command remain outside writable mounts on every managed
launch, including unrestricted mode. A future worktree parent containing them
is rejected with relocation guidance. Rerun setup to change saved workspace
scope, or invoke the installed wrapper directly for per-invocation choices.
The invoked command's own path is checked as well as the configured path,
including relative invocation, copied dispatchers and symlink aliases. A command
or alias inside the effective writable workspace/state is rejected before launch.
When setup changes the managed command path, it retires the previous owned
command after publishing the new one. A retirement/publication failure restores
the previous activation and leaves the previous command intact. The plan names
the command to be retired; unrelated files are never removed.

Existing dispatchers from before this path-check protocol are upgraded
atomically by setup. Such a dispatcher can still request help/setup, but normal
launch against the new helper fails closed until the upgrade. Run setup from the
updated checkout to install both matching components; no image refresh is needed.
Direct `claude-container.sh` retains its existing environment-based behavior and
does not load a global configuration. Managed help bypasses preferences and
Python, including when preferences are corrupt. Setup rerun uses saved choices;
to repair invalid JSON, first review/restore the affected file or use a reviewed
checkout and a different installation root.

Rerunning from the installed command reconfigures that installed source version.
To install updated source, run setup from the reviewed updated checkout and
select the same installation root. Runtime images use distinct candidate tags;
proxy references are immutable IDs. An explicitly authorized ordinary
`--container-build` still operates on the selected named runtime image and is
separate from setup's release transaction.

The previous release is retained. For rollback, stop setup updates, take the
same installation lock, inspect the previous release and its `setup.json`, then
atomically replace `current` with a symlink to that release. Alternatively run
the prior manual wrapper with its explicit environment. Never delete state to
roll back. Automatic pruning is not provided. New image tags and enabled user
sockets can remain after failure; setup reports persistent effects and does not
remove shared engine resources or undo service enablement automatically.
If rolling back across a command-path or dispatcher-protocol change, restore
the matching command/configuration as well; changing only `current` does not
recreate a retired command or adapt an older launch helper's interface.

## Readiness and authentication

Setup smoke-checks the actual installed wrapper with the selected state, network
and CA settings, without credentials in its environment or a model request. It
checks the Claude executable; restricted smoke also exercises enforced Unix
socket denial, direct egress denial, own-loopback/pair compatibility and, for
provider mode, the confined proxy deny path. ABI query success alone is not
accepted. Failure prevents activation and returns nonzero.

When the smoke launch fails, or does not confirm readiness, setup prints the
last lines of the wrapper's standard error, labeled `claude-container: smoke:`,
before `setup incomplete`. For example, a wrapper refusal of a state directory
appears there. The excerpt holds at most 5 non-empty lines of at most 2048
characters, with control characters removed. A successful smoke prints none of
it, so routine wrapper notices stay hidden.

Completion distinguishes:

| Result | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Sandbox: ready`, authentication pending | Installation/smoke passed; login/key configuration still needs user action. Setup returns zero. |
| `Sandbox: ready`, account login verified | Claude login succeeded through this sandbox; no model request was tested. |
| `Sandbox: ready`, authentication not applicable | Offline sandbox is usable without provider authentication. |
| setup incomplete | A prerequisite/preparation/smoke step failed. Setup returns nonzero and leaves the last activated release selected. |

Account users can reuse shared state or accept optional
`auth login --claudeai` in the selected fresh isolated sandbox. Claude displays
the login flow directly and owns credential persistence; setup never captures
codes, credential-bearing URLs or tokens. Login cancellation/failure leaves a
ready sandbox with authentication pending. To log in later:

```bash
"$HOME/.local/bin/claude-container" auth login --claudeai
```

API setup does not collect or save an API key. Provider/API launches use the
existing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment forwarding by name. Supply that variable
through your normal private secret mechanism when launching. The existing
unrestricted wrapper does not add API-key environment forwarding; use
provider/API or explicitly configured Claude credentials for that workflow.
Setup performs no paid model request. Shell/version smoke, account login and
authenticated model-response evidence remain separate.

The wrapper reclassifies Podman 4.3's successful `Should restart: false` message
as informational (`INFO[...]` or `level=info`), preserving its timestamp and
message. All other stderr bytes, including actual restart-check errors, remain
unchanged; interactive prompts do not wait for a newline. The host-side adapter
is installed by setup and its owned process shares the wrapper shutdown budget.
Legacy direct unrestricted installations lacking host Python or the adapter keep
their original Podman diagnostics instead of gaining a Python prerequisite.

## Verification

Synthetic tests use fake engines, PTYs and disposable native state:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_setup.py -v
bash tests/run-runtime.sh --setup       # container-provided Python/native storage
bash tests/run-runtime.sh --setup-runtime  # opt-in real rootless setup acceptance
bash tests/run-runtime.sh --qualification  # installed-path gate and report checks
```

Runtime checks use existing prepared images, disposable installation/state and
an existing same-host service; they do not enable user services or access real
credentials. Real systemd activation and optional real login require a user to
accept their respective setup prompts. Record unexercised variants as unavailable
in `docs/validation.md` and retain the optional status of a real API-key request.

The `container-setup` requirement coverage is:

| Requirement | Verification |
| --- | --- |
| Dedicated interactive setup invocation | PTY early-dispatch, mixed-argument/pipeline rejection and help precedence tests |
| Workflow questionnaire with explicit defaults | Default/retry/conflict PTY checks; saved-choice rerun; real provider/offline/unrestricted paths |
| Optional authority requires deliberate selection | Delegation conflict questionnaire; separate service confirmation; saved worktree/TTY checks |
| Installed host prerequisites only | Missing command, unsupported context/platform and strict failed/malformed engine-response tests |
| User-scoped Podman service preparation | Synthetic accepted/declined/unavailable systemd and exact-endpoint tests; real existing-service reuse |
| Reviewed setup mutations and maintenance | Declined plan has no filesystem/image mutation; scoped maintenance/environment tests |
| Protected complete installation | Native manifest copy from Windows checkout; path/ancestor/overlap/state/privacy checks |
| Mode-specific image and guard preparation | Inspection/recipe pin/build failure/guard preflight tests; real compilation and provider/offline/unrestricted smoke |
| Persistent non-secret managed launch preferences | Schema/privacy/secret rejection, empty overrides, argv/stdin/cwd/TTY/status/signal and future-mount tests |
| Credential-preserving authentication assistance | Synthetic direct-terminal login success/failure/cancellation and absent-key cases; real login separately opt-in |
| Verified readiness with separate authentication status | Actual installed guard, proxy deny path, CA off/on, version/shell and explicit pending/not-applicable results |
| Repeatable setup with owned recovery | Lock/publication/interruption/container cleanup tests; real rerun and failed-candidate rollback |

Adversarial regression checks additionally cover managed-command relocation,
retirement failure/rollback, legacy dispatcher upgrade and writable aliases.
Timeout checks include an already-exited group leader and a descendant that
closes pipes on TERM while continuing to run. Tests use a separate Linux
subreaper to collect their own orphaned descendants without leaving zombies.
