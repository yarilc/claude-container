# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Ephemeral constrained temporary storage
Sessions SHALL disable automatic read-only tmpfs provisioning and explicitly provide ephemeral `/tmp`, `/run`, and `/var/tmp` mounts with `rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec`. Limits SHALL be 256 MiB for `/tmp`, 16 MiB for `/run`, and 256 MiB for `/var/tmp`. `/tmp` and `/var/tmp` SHALL permit caller writes with sticky directory mode `1777`. Temporary contents SHALL disappear after container removal. Internal sandbox compatibility SHALL NOT silently relax these options.

#### Scenario: Temporary file lifecycle
- **WHEN** a session writes temporary files in `/tmp` and `/var/tmp` and a new container starts after its removal
- **THEN** both paths accept caller writes but the previous files are absent
- **AND** all three temporary mounts retain `nosuid,nodev,noexec` and their specified limits

#### Scenario: Temporary mounts are explicit
- **WHEN** a Claude or shell session is created in shared or isolated state mode
- **THEN** automatic read-only tmpfs provisioning is disabled and `/tmp`, `/run`, and `/var/tmp` are explicitly provisioned
- **AND** no writable `/var/log` tmpfs is introduced by automatic read-only provisioning

#### Scenario: Execution restrictions apply to both temporary directories
- **WHEN** a session attempts to execute a copied executable directly from `/tmp` or `/var/tmp`
- **THEN** the mount policy prevents direct execution from either directory
- **AND** ordinary temporary file writes remain possible
